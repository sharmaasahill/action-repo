This repository serves as the **event source** for the webhook receiver application. It's designed to trigger GitHub webhook events that are captured by our webhook receiver application, demonstrating real-time GitHub integration capabilities.

## Architecture Role

```
This Repository (action-repo)
       ↓ Triggers webhook events
GitHub Webhooks API
       ↓ Sends events to
Webhook Receiver Application
       ↓ Displays events in
Real-time Dashboard
```

## Purpose

This repository is specifically designed to generate **three types of GitHub webhook events**:

### Push Events
Triggered when code is pushed to any branch
- **Action**: `git push`
- **Result**: Webhook event sent to receiver
- **Display**: Author, branch, timestamp

### Pull Request Events  
Triggered when pull requests are created
- **Action**: Create PR via GitHub interface
- **Result**: Webhook event sent to receiver
- **Display**: Author, source→target branches, timestamp

### Merge Events
Triggered when pull requests are merged
- **Action**: Merge PR via GitHub interface  
- **Result**: Webhook event sent to receiver
- **Display**: Merger, merged branches, timestamp

## Webhook Configuration

To connect this repository to your webhook receiver:

### Setup Webhook
1. Go to **Settings** → **Webhooks** → **Add webhook**
2. Configure as follows:
   ```
   Payload URL: https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok.io/webhook
   Content type: application/json
   Secret: (optional, match your receiver config)
   Events: Push  Pull requests
   Active: Yes
   ```

### Verify Configuration
- Webhook is **Active**
- Events include **Push** and **Pull requests**
- Payload URL points to your webhook receiver
- Content type is **application/json**

## Testing Guide

### Test Push Events

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/sharmaasahill/action-repo.git
cd action-repo

# Make a simple change
echo "Test change at $(date)" >> test-file.txt

# Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "Test: Trigger push webhook event"
git push origin main
```

**Expected Result**: Push event appears in webhook receiver dashboard

### Test Pull Request Events

```bash
# Create a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/webhook-test-$(date +%s)

# Make changes
echo "Feature: Webhook testing at $(date)" >> feature.txt
git add .
git commit -m "Add: Feature for PR webhook testing"

# Push feature branch
git push origin feature/webhook-test-$(date +%s)
```

**Then on GitHub**:
1. Navigate to this repository
2. Click **"Compare & pull request"** button
3. Add title: `Test: PR webhook event`
4. Click **"Create pull request"**

**Expected Result**: Pull request event appears in webhook receiver dashboard

### Test Merge Events

**After creating the pull request above**:
1. Click **"Merge pull request"** button
2. Confirm merge by clicking **"Confirm merge"**
3. Optionally delete the feature branch

**Expected Result**: Merge event appears in webhook receiver dashboard

## Event Monitoring

All webhook events generated by this repository can be monitored in real-time:

### Webhook Receiver Dashboard
- **URL**: `http://localhost:5000` (when receiver is running)
- **Updates**: Every 15 seconds automatically
- **Display**: All events with timestamps and details

### Expected Event Formats
- **Push**: `{author} pushed to {branch} on {timestamp}`
- **Pull Request**: `{author} submitted a pull request from {from_branch} to {to_branch} on {timestamp}`
- **Merge**: `{author} merged branch {from_branch} to {to_branch} on {timestamp}`

## Testing Checklist

Use this checklist to verify all webhook events are working:

- [ ] **Webhook configured** in repository settings
- [ ] **Receiver application** running at webhook URL
- [ ] **Push event** - Make commit and push
- [ ] **Pull request event** - Create PR from feature branch  
- [ ] **Merge event** - Merge the PR
- [ ] **Real-time display** - Events appear in dashboard
- [ ] **Correct formatting** - Events match expected format
